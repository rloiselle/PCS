This week's exam is slightly different. Because we've done the ruby exam before, I'd like to try an experiment and see how different the results are. Instead of providing a test, we would like you to find a way to demonstrate that you know the essential goals. This will take far more time to grade but it may be worth it if it allows people to extend and show their true potential.

Create a project that uses as many of these goals as possible. Bold lines must be present. Some of these goals may not be demonstrable, note that and move on.

Most important step You must annotate what goal you're trying to illustrate in comments above the code blocks.
