<!-- Step 1:

Start a new project with yesterday’s game in mind. This time there is only one box, the Wipe link, and a Reset link.
When you click on the box, not only does it turn blue, it spawns boxes next to, above and below the box.
Wipe now removes the color of all the boxes, but doesn’t remove the new boxes.
Reset removes all the extra boxes.
Step 2:

Add a counter and a score tracker to the bottom of the game.
When you click on a box it spawns boxes near it and colors them, but the next click turns all five boxes red.
Each click reduces the play counter and changes the score tracker to reflect how many red and green boxes there are on the field. -->
