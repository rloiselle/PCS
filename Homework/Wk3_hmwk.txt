WEEK 3: Learning With JQuery

MONDAY READING QUESTIONS: CHAPTERS 1-2

1.) In your own words, summarize the 7 things on page 9-11 that jQuery does well

- .find method makes it easy to find elements in a document without having to write multiplie lines of complex code
- .addClass method allows a class to be changed or added to part of a document
- the structure and content of a document can be moved around or inserted by using the Application Programming Interface
- there is an event handler API which simplifies user interactions by making the required coding more simple and automatically controlling issues with browser incompatibilities
- Interaction effects which provide visual feedback to the user are available
- automatic page reloading tools are available for  when information must be taken from the server
- libraries for basic data manipulation are available

2.) How do you include external javascript files in HTML

-  <script src="jquery.js"></script>  #src is the pathway and filename


3.) Should jquery.js get included before or after our project files?

-  After, to ensure that all .js enabled features are loaded before .js is run

4.) What does this code do and why do we use it? $(document).ready()

-  It loads the .js functions only after all document elements are loaded

5.) What code would you use to select these things:
- an element:  $("element")
- an id: $("#id_name")
- a class: $(".class-name")
- a p tag, inside a div with class “turkey”, inside a body with the id “thanksgiving”.
---> $("#thanksgiving.turkey:p")

How would you add “tiger stripes” to a table with jQuery? (tiger stripes are alternating background colors)

    $(document).ready(function() {
    $('tr:nth-child(odd)').addClass('tiger-stripes');
    });

How do we select only checkboxes that are currently checked?

- $('input[type="checkbox"]:checked')

(research) What is the keyboard command to open the Chrome element inspector? To open the Chrome console?

-  cmd-alt-i

#TUESDAY READING QUESTIONS: CHAPTERS 3-4

1.) What is the most common short version of $(document).ready()?

- window.onload is slightly different or shortcut to writing doc.ready fxn is:
      $(function() {
        //code
      });

2.) What is “progressive enhancement”?

-  enhanced element of the page should only be available if JS is enabled or provide links to pages where js is not needed.

3.) How do you bind a click event to a button?

-  $('button').bind('click', function(){
      //code here
});

4.) Inside a click handler, what is the variable this set to?

-  this corresponds to the element which the user is engaging

5.) What is event bubbling?

-   event propogates from the most specific to the most general element at the top of the chain.


6.) How do we stop an event from bubbling up the chain?

-  event.stopPropagations(); when event is a parameter given to the immediately preceding function.
    -- this only works for event handlers

7.) How do we stop an element from taking its default action (e.g. a submit button will refresh the page or submit a form)

- .preventDefault()  will prevent an action from being triggered until desired

8.) How do we remove a binding?

- .unbind(), but care must be taken because unbind can affect other event handlers. To avoid this, provide a specific arguement to the method .unbind()

9.) How do we hide and show elements?

-  .hide()
-  .show()
10.) How do we blur or slide elements?

-  .blur()
-  .slide()

WEDNESDAY READING QUESTIONS: CHAPTER 5

1.) How do you alter an a tag’s href attribute?

- .attr()

2.) How do you create new content and add it to the page?

- to create: $("#id"), $(<element>"), (".class")
- to add to page: .insertBefore(), .prependTo(), .appendTo(), .insertAfter()

3.) How do you move content within the page?

-  .insertBefore()
-  .insertAfter()
- in the parentheses, put the targeted element where the new information should be placed before or after.

4.) What jQuery function do we use to iterate over all elements in a jQuery set?

-  .each(index,value) for array
-  .each(key, value)  for object

5.) How do you copy a DOM element? How do you copy any event listeners as well?

-  .clone() will copy any element, but an insertion method is required inorder to use the copied element elsewhere.
-  .cloneCopy(withDataAndEvents)

6.) What’s the difference between .text() and .html()?

-  .text() only retrieves content, .html() retrieves content and html coding

7.) How do we remove all the content inside an element?

-  .empty().  Not to be confused with .remove() which removes the element and everything inside it.  Nor .detach with removes the elements without removing data and events.

8.) When you insert new content into the page, does it have bindings attached to it? If not, how do we make sure that existing bindings that should have targeted the new element, do?
