MONDAY READING QUESTIONS

1.) In your own words, summarize the 7 things on page 9-11 that jQuery does well

- .find method makes it easy to find elements in a document without having to write multiplie lines of complex code
- .addClass method allows a class to be changed or added to part of a document
- the structure and content of a document can be moved around or inserted by using the Application Programming Interface
- there is an event handler API which simplifies user interactions by making the required coding more simple and automatically controlling issues with browser incompatibilities
- Interaction effects which provide visual feedback to the user are available
- automatic page reloading tools are available for  when information must be taken from the server
- libraries for basic data manipulation are available

2.) How do you include external javascript files in HTML

-  <script src="jquery.js"></script>  #src is the pathway and filename


3.) Should jquery.js get included before or after our project files?

-  After, to ensure that all .js enabled features are loaded before .js is run

4.) What does this code do and why do we use it? $(document).ready()

-  It loads the .js functions only after all document elements are loaded

5.) What code would you use to select these things:
- an element:  $("element")
- an id: $("#id_name")
- a class: $(".class-name")
- a p tag, inside a div with class “turkey”, inside a body with the id “thanksgiving”.
---> $("#thanksgiving.turkey:p")

How would you add “tiger stripes” to a table with jQuery? (tiger stripes are alternating background colors)

#TUESDAY READING QUESTIONS

1.) What is the most common short version of $(document).ready()?

- window.onload is slightly different or shortcut to writing doc.ready fxn is:
      $(function() {
        //code
      });

2.) What is “progressive enhancement”?

-  enhanced element of the page should only be available if JS is enabled or provide links to pages where js is not needed.

3.) How do you bind a click event to a button?

-  $('button').bind('click', function(){
      //code here
});

4.) Inside a click handler, what is the variable this set to?

-  this corresponds to the element which the user is engaging

5.) What is event bubbling?

-   event propogates from the most specific to the most general element at the top of the chain.


6.) How do we stop an event from bubbling up the chain?

-  event.stopPropagations(); when event is a parameter given to the immediately preceding function.
    -- this only works for event handlers

7.) How do we stop an element from taking its default action (e.g. a submit button will refresh the page or submit a form)

- .preventDefault()  will prevent an action from being triggered until desired

8.) How do we remove a binding?

- .unbind(), but care must be taken because unbind can affect other event handlers. To avoid this, provide a specific arguement to the method .unbind()

9.) How do we hide and show elements?

-  .hide()
-  .show()
10.) How do we blur or slide elements?

-  .blur()
-  .slide()
